      <h3>
        Denham and JonJon met in their computer science honours class. Denham
        looked like he had no friends and JonJon took a leap of faith and
        invited him to join the cool kids for lunch. They have been building
        cool things ever since.
      </h3>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Togther they are currently working on wildcards.world and
        alwaysforsale.io - unique projects that combine interesting incetive
        mechanisms. The success of these projects has led them to a move to
        Station F in Paris where they will continue to build.
